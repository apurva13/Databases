We created a linear regression equation to predict the MEDV in which we got 11 terms which are stated as (weight * features) and one intercept term in the equation.We have a total of 14 terms but only 11 of them are selected in the equation, because the terms AGE and INDUS have the smallest standardized regression coefficients and are step-wisely removed from the model as no improvement is observed.This is M5 attribute selection method. The term "CHAS=0" is also not present in the linear regression equation as removing these terms did not affect the error value.
